	* Added an API function to model the data skew in the shuffle phase

2014-08-13  version 3.11

	FEATURES

	Basic Behavior
	* Map and Reduce phases (no explicit Combine)
	* Single job simulation
	* Speculative execution mechanism (backup tasks)
	* Algorithms Heterogeneous

	Distributed File System
	* Data locality
	* Chunk replicas

	API
	* User function to set task costs
	* User function to distribute chunks and replicas

	Configuration Options
	* Chunk size (MB)
	* Job input size (in chunks)
	* Number of chunk replicas
	* Number of reduce tasks
	* Number of execution slots
	* Factor of Partition Reduce for Granularity Control
	* Intermediates Data output percentage
